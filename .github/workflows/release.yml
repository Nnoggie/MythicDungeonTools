name: Package and release

# we need to let GitHub know _when_ we want to release, typically only when we create a new tag.
# this will target only tags, and not all pushes to the master branch.
# this part can be heavily customized to your liking, like targeting only tags that match a certain word,
# other branches or even pullrequests.

# a workflow is built up as jobs, and within these jobs are steps
jobs:

  # "release" is a job, you can name it anything you want
  release:

    # we can run our steps on pretty much anything, but the "ubuntu-latest" image is a safe bet
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # specify the environment variables used by the packager, matching the secrets from the project on GitHub
    env:
      CF_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
      GITHUB_OAUTH: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # "GITHUB_TOKEN" is a secret always provided to the workflow
                                                 # for your own token, the name cannot start with "GITHUB_"

    # "steps" holds a list of all the steps needed to package and release our AddOn

      # we first have to clone the AddOn project, this is a required step

      # once cloned, we just run the GitHub Action for the packager project
