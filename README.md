## Description

Mythic Dungeon Tools is a Mythic+ Dungeon Planner AddOn which helps you perfectly plan out your strategies and pull patterns in Mythic+ Dungeons. Every NPC in every Mythic+ dungeon has been mapped out and can be viewed on an interactive map. Furthermore you have the option to select these enemies and divide the enemies you wish to defeat into pulls. While going through the dungeon and selecting more enemies the progress bar will fill up and you will know exactly which enemies to defeat to reach perfect enemy forces count. When done with selecting enemies the route can be exported and shared via a paste string or send to party members ingame so other users of the AddOn can see what you have planned for the dungeon.
